# Stein.js Boilerplate

Boilerplate app mostly for personal use, feel free to check it out, but it's probably not your cup-o-tea

After cloning this repo:

- Delete .git, .gitignore, README.md
- Run `yarn install` inside the assets directory

The following commands are available in the assets directory:

- `yarn devserver`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn build:production`
- `yarn watch`
- `yarn watch:production`


Make sure you change the paths in webpack.config.js, currently, the output goes to assets/public/assets

GL!
